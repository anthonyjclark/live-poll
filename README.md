# Live Poll

A simple live poll that I can upload to Domain of One's Own.

Features to add:
- [ ] Generic question and answer options
- [ ] Question types (multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
- [ ] Option to hide results until the poll is closed
- [ ] Password for admin page
- [ ] More options on admin page
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Generate [static QR code](https://qr.io/)

Maybe look at Kahoot for ideas?

## Testing

Test the live poll by running the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
